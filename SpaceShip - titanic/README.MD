# Spaceship Titanic - Classification Project

## Overview

The "Spaceship Titanic" project is a predictive analysis aimed at determining which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension using a fictional dataset from the space Titanic. This project leverages machine learning techniques to build a classification model that predicts whether a passenger was transported or not based on various features.

## Objective

Develop a classification model that accurately predicts if a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension. The project involves:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model selection and tuning
- Evaluation and submission

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Feature engineering

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize and analyze distributions and correlations
   - Identify significant patterns and insights

3. **Modeling**:
   - Test basic models: `Logistic Regression` and `Random Forest`
   - Implement and optimize `XGBoost`
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning using `Optuna`

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Analyze metrics such as accuracy and log loss
   - Optimize the model based on evaluation results

5. **Submission**:
   - Prepare the final submission file in CSV format

## Key Findings

- **Age Distribution**: Passengers under 12 years old have a higher likelihood of being transported.
- **Cryosleep**: Passengers in cryosleep are more likely to be transported.
- **Side and Deck Analysis**: Passengers on the 'S' side and those on decks B and C are more likely to be transported.
